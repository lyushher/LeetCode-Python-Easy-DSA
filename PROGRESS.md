## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Arrays & Brute Force

- âœ… [Two Sum](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-01/two_sum.py)  
- âœ… [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-01/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py) 

**Notes:** Practiced brute force and greedy techniques. Focused on understanding nested iteration and real-time min tracking.

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Arrays & Hashing Fundamentals

- âœ… [Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-02/contains_duplicate.py)
- âœ… [Valid Anagran](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-02/valid_anagram.py)

**Notes:** Applied hashing strategies to detect duplicates and analyze character distributions in strings.
Focused on optimizing search and comparison operations using constant-time lookups with sets and dictionaries.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 3 - Hash Maps & Voting Algorithm

- âœ… [Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-03/intersection_of_two_arrays_2.py)
- âœ… [Majority Element](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-03/majority_element.py)

**Notes:** Utilized hash maps to solve array intersection problems with duplicate tracking.  
Applied Boyerâ€“Moore Voting to optimize majority element detection to O(1) space â€” a core interview pattern.

## ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Bit Manipulation Patterns
- âœ… [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)
- âœ… [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

**Notes:** Explored XOR-based logic to isolate non-duplicate values and determine missing elements efficiently.
Applied bit-level identities like `a ^ a = 0` to reduce problems into linear-time, constant-space operations.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ In-Place Algorithms & Simulation Logic
- âœ… [Merge Sorted Array](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-05/merged_sorted_array.py)
- âœ… [Plus One](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-05/plus_one.py)

**Notes:** Focused on in-place merging by shifting from the back to preserve original values during overwrite.
Handled number incrementation digit by digit, managing carry propagation without relying on conversions.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 6 â€“ String Filtering & Substring Matching
- âœ… [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
- âœ… [Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

**Notes:** Cleaned and normalized string inputs to handle case and symbol inconsistencies.
Used a sliding window approach to locate substrings, reinforcing logic used in low-level pattern matching problems.
