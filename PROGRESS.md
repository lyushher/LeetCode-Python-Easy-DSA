## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Arrays & Brute Force

- âœ… [Two Sum](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-01/two_sum.py)  
- âœ… [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-01/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py) 

**Notes:** Practiced brute force and greedy techniques. Focused on understanding nested iteration and real-time min tracking.

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Arrays & Hashing Fundamentals

- âœ… [Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-02/contains_duplicate.py)
- âœ… [Valid Anagran](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-02/valid_anagram.py)

**Notes:** Practiced common hashing techniques including membership checks with sets and character frequency mapping using dictionaries.  
Learned how to reduce time complexity with hash-based lookups in array and string problems.

## ðŸ“… Day 3 - Hash Maps & Voting Algorithm

- âœ… [Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-03/intersection_of_two_arrays_2.py)
- âœ… [Majority Element](https://github.com/lyushher/LeetCode-Python-Easy-DSA/blob/main/day-03/majority_element.py)

**Notes:**  Utilized hash maps to solve array intersection problems with duplicate tracking.  
Applied Boyerâ€“Moore Voting to optimize majority element detection to O(1) space â€” a core interview pattern.
