# LeetCode Python Easy – Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

 A dedicated repository for solving **easy-level LeetCode problems** using **Python**, focused on strengthening my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** foundation.

---

## 🚀 Purpose & Long-Term Objective

This repository serves as a structured, long-term preparation resource for mastering problem-solving in Python, with a focus on data structures and algorithms commonly tested in technical interviews.

It is designed for individuals aiming to:

- Strengthen core algorithmic thinking through consistent, high-quality practice
- Gain fluency in solving real-world DSA problems under time constraints
- Prepare for technical interviews at top-tier software companies and high-impact engineering teams
- Build a well-documented reference of reusable patterns and scalable coding techniques

Each solution is implemented with clarity and purpose, balancing readability with technical depth.  
The overall structure is crafted to support both personal growth and professional readiness in competitive software engineering environments.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Each topic includes classic patterns frequently asked in interviews by FAANG and top-tier companies.

- ✅ Arrays & Hash Maps – Searching, frequency counting, duplicates, merging
- ✅ Strings & Stacks – String manipulation, palindrome checks, parentheses validation
- ✅ Linked Lists – Reversal, cycle detection, list merging, deletion
- ✅ Recursion & Binary Search – Divide & conquer, search strategies, math problems
- ✅ Trees (DFS / BFS) – Depth calculation, traversal, tree comparison
- ✅ Sliding Window – Substring analysis, window shifting for optimization
- 🔁 Concept Review (Day 26–30) – Final week for mixed practice & revision

> This roadmap is based on a 30-day structured learning plan focused on Python and LeetCode’s most frequently asked topics.
